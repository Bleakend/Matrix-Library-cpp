# Matrix Library
this is a personal side project that consists of building a Matrix class 
that would allow the users of this class to create Matrix objects and do simple operations on those matrices

## Files included
For the moment there are only 2 files:
    * Matrix.h
    * Matrix.cpp
    these files consist of the whole Matrix class

    *Main.cpp
    this is a file that contains some simple use cases of the library
